## Introduction:

In this module, you will learn about the practical application of simple linear regression through hands-on experience with essential libraries and tools. We will explore the utilization of programming libraries like pandas for efficient data manipulation, matplotlib for visualizing results, and potentially specialized tools like scikit-learn to streamline the implementation of regression models. This practical exposure will equip you with the skills needed to effectively apply simple linear regression to real-world datasets, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and the technical proficiency required for successful data analysis.
